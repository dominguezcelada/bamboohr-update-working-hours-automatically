# BambooHR Working Hours automation

Automatically add working hours of an employee in [BambooHR](https://www.bamboohr.com/)

## Context test

The [company](https://www.marfeel.com) I'm currently working for requires to fulfill a form every day of the month with the amount of hours worked in BambooHR platform. This is due the [new law](https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2019-3481) the Spanish government created a few months ago.
Apparently BambooHR plugin to add Working Hours does not offer settings to automate or add by default values to this form.

I first tried to interact with [BambooHR API](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/docs) but it requires a Private Key which is not possible to be provided by [my current company](https://www.marfeel.com) right now.

That's why I opt for a headless solution to add the manual interaction a user would do so it can be automated.

## Tools/Language/Technologies

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions)
  - from Monday to Friday at 8am (GMT)
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)

## Project Structure:

- `.github/workflows/bamboohr-puppeteer.yml`: Simulate UI interactions with BambooHR UI through headless browser solution (Puppeteer)
- `src/index.ts`: File run by Puppeteer to interact with BambooHR UI site to finally register Working Hours on _BambooHR's Working Hours Plugin_
- `src/bamboo-hr-interactions/*`: Different interactions taken over BambooHR UI Components with Puppeteer (click, type...)
